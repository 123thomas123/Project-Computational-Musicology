Comparing HipHop to Drum and Bass using the Spotify API

This project will compare the genre Drum and Bass with the genre HipHop. I have made two playlists that contain 100 songs from the each of the 2 genres. All songs come from searching the genre in Spotify and then adding songs until a 100 songs were reached. 
The question is mainly, what are the differences in these music genres (according to Spotify)?

Interesting thusfar are comparisons on danceability, energy, tempo and valence. As measured from the Spotify API, danceability of HipHop was much higher (M = 0.74, SD = 0.13) than the danceability of Drum and Bass (M = 0.53, SD = 0.11).
The energy of Drum and Bass was higher (M = 0.90, SD = 0.09) than the energy of HipHop (M = 0.69, SD = 0.15)
The tempo of Drum and Bass was much higher (M = 160, SD = 31) than the tempo of HipHop (M = 114, SD = 34)
The valence of Drum and Bass was much lower (M = 0.27, SD = 0.19) than the valence of HipHop (M = 0.60, SD = 0.21)

There seems to be some extreme values when looking at the minimum and maximum values within danceability, energy, tempo and valence but they are not confirmed as outliers yet.

The most surprising/interesting finding for me is that the danceability of HipHop is according to Spotify much higher than the danceability for Drum and Bass. I think personally that Drum and Bass is much more danceable so it makes me curious what kind of measurements are used to get to the variable danceability.
